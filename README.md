# Depthmap to pointcloud

This is my attempt at reprojecting 2d data back in to the 3d space using depth maps. For my work I used DPT to generate the depth maps (https://github.com/isl-org/DPT). And I have used the pointcloudkit plugin (https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/point-cloud-kit) to render the pointcloud. Make sure to download the plugin and place in the plugins folder.
